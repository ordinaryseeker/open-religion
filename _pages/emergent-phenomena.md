<h3>Motivation</h3>
A concise yet insightful introduction to emergent phenomena from particle physics, to chemistry, to biology, to psychology, to sociology and economics. This serves to prove that evolution is not an exception and that many systems have a "blind designer". But more importantly, it also lays the foundation of how Open Religion itself will be governed in a bottom up way. There is no one optimum way for humans to live. Can we design simple rules that can help most people arrive at their own optimums?
