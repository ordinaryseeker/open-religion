<h3>Motivation</h3>
Analyzing the evidence for a God as traditionally conceptualized in the light of modern discoveries and speculations on alternatives.
<h3>Content</h3>
Many of us want God to exist. Life would be so much better under the watchful eye of a caring yet forgiving, generous yet powerful creator who ensures fairness in the world, who rewards good deeds and punishes the evil.

Unfortunately, as we have come to understand more and more about how the world operates, the evidence pointing to the existence of such a God has been found severely lacking while the evidence pointing to alternative mechanisms that could explain many of the things we once attributed to God has been mounting at a breathtaking rate.

We are far from knowing all there is to know about how the world was created and how it operates. Modern science still has many puzzles to answer about the Big Bang that we think created the universe 13.8 billion years ago. We cannot confirm or deny the role of a creator in creating this universe and the rules that govern it. But the the creator God that is at the center of most religions seems like a figment of imagination of our less knowledgeable ancestors.

If you are still not convinced about this ask yourself the following questions and be honest with yourself.
<ul>
 	<li>Saving Innocent Lives :
<ul>
 	<li>The inventions that have saved the most human lives are Public Sanitation, Antibiotics and Vaccines. Did the religious books of your religion give humanity the blue-prints or recipes for these inventions? Did your "God" or any of his prophets  create the above by miracles?</li>
 	<li>With so many children and mothers dying during childbirth,  did your "God" reveal the technology we have to today to prevent all this avoidable suffering?</li>
 	<li>With so many people dying in famines and droughts, did your "God" reveal Water Desalination technology?</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Geographic Isolation:
<ul>
 	<li>Google was created in 1998 and yet in mere 10 years it could be accessed directly from anywhere in the world. Why did an all powerful God not create a similar mechanism to access Him directly? Why did the Native Americans had to wait for more than a 1000 years before hearing about Jesus , Muhammad or Krishna?</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Knowledge:
<ul>
 	<li>Why did none of the revelations reveal that the earth was round and went around the sun and the sun was just one star in the galaxy and our galaxy was just one in a billion galaxies?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
As the great Bob Dylan would say, "The answer my friend is blowing in the wind, the answer is blowing in the wind."
