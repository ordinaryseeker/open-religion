<h3>Motivation</h3>
A concise explanation of Darwin's Theory of Evolution and why such a seemingly ridiculous theory has gained a consensus  among scientists and its implications
<h3>Content</h3>
How life and humans came to be is a topic that almost every culture has explored. Creation myths around the world have come up with some imaginative stories to explain something that each of us has wondered about atleast sometimes in our lives. These stories are as contradictory as they are diverse but almost all of them have one thing in common, a creator. A creator is an active agent who brings order to chaos, light to darkness and life to a lifeless world. Even among dozens of imaginative stories, order without a creator is literally unimaginable to our ancestors. That is until Charles Darwin.

In 1859, Charles Darwin published On The Origin of Species, a book in which he proposed a seemingly ridiculous idea that different species of life evolved by the random process of Natural Selection. At first this theory was not widely accepted but as evidence mounted in its favor from various disciplines, it was no longer possible to deny that all life, including humans, evolved from simple organisms by a random process without the active help of any creator. (See Technical Note below for more details).

It has been nearly 150 years since this discovery but we seldom stop to think about ourselves as products of a random process. Indeed,most of the time, we continue to live life like we were created for a purpose or that we have some sort of a destiny or that we have some God given rights. Even in personal life we act as if  we ourselves are perfectly rational or that we know how to take care of our bodies and in social life we follow and enforce social rules about right and wrong and good and evil. All these notions are remnants of the time when our ancestors genuinely believed that humans were created by a God, who had given each of them some kind of a test and some rules to do well in the test.

Much of the society is  still ignorant about this, while a significant portion is in active denial. But for those of us who have accepted the truth of evolution, we have a task on our hand. We have not taken the time to dig into the implications of this momentous discovery and design new guidelines for personal and social life going forward.
