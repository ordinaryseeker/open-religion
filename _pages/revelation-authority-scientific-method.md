<strong>Motivation</strong>

A discussion about how knowledge has been acquired throughout human history. The pros and cons of the major methods and why human knowledge acquisition has accelerated in the past 300 years.

<strong>Content</strong>

One of the most important questions that humanity has had to figure out is how to acquire knowledge about the nature of reality. For most of humanity this question did not have a satisfactory answer.

One of the most powerful methods of acquiring important knowledge was "Revelation", where some supernatural being/power would revel a truth about reality to a person. The benefits of this method were obvious, we just had to wait for enough revelations to get a complete picture of reality.  Unfortunately the drawback was that anybody could claim to have had a revelation and we would just have to take their word for it. Also different revelations could contradict each other.

Another popular method was deducing the nature of reality by logical thinking. One could sit in an arm chair or in a cave and work out how the world worked just by carefully thinking about it. Unfortunately the world we lived in proved to be a little too complex for this method. For example just by your daily experience it is easy to think that the earth is flat and that the sun goes around the earth. While seemingly so obvious, we now know that these claims are not true.

A related method to the two above is getting knowledge from an authority. We believed something to be true just because an important person or book or tablet said it, This method, while convenient, does leave the question open how did that person or author of the book or tablet know the truth. And we get back to square one.

One of the remarkable discoveries of the past few centuries that has lead to the rapid acceleration in our knowledge about the world is the "Scientific Method".  Stated simply it is the method of observing the world around us, coming up with an explanation for the thing we observe (a hypotheses), gathering evidence to dis-confirm our hypotheses  and being open to conditionally accept or permanently reject a hypotheses based on the evidence.

Note three subtle peculiarities of this method. We always seek evidence to dis-confirm our hypotheses. This is because it is easy to only seek evidence to confirm our pet theory and then give up the search.  For example if I observe a few cows and they are black and so I make an hypotheses that "All cows are black". To support my hypotheses it is not enough just to gather evidence of how many black cows I have seen since this claim because observing even one non-black cow will refute the claim.  So it is important to seek evidence to refute your own claim .

Also it is important to frame a hypotheses in a way that it is testable and falsifiable . If I claim that "Some cows appear purple to me". This claim is not testable by others since they cannot see what colors I see. Similarly if I claim "If you see a red cow  something good will happen that day", this claim is not falsifiable since I can spin any event in the day or the absence of a bad event to claim it to be "good".

Lastly you never accept a hypotheses permanently, you only accept it  conditionally. Which means if the evidence changes then you are open to refuting it. On the other hand refutation is permanent.

Does the scientific method have any drawbacks? It has a few.

First, we have to give up the notion of "certainty" and accept "most probable given the evidence".

Second we have to realize that not everything worth observing is observable directly and so we have to settle for imperfect indirect measures. For example we might want to observe the exact chemical composition of the earth when it was formed but that data is not preserved directly anywhere and so we just have look for known signatures of candidate chemicals for evidence.

Lastly, any search with this method needs funding and resources (unlike revelations and thinking which can be done for free). This might insert limitations and even biases into the process.

But to conclude, it is important to note that despite its drawbacks the Scientific Method is the only reliable method of knowing the nature of reality known to man. We have known more about the world in the past 300 years than the million years before that combined, thanks to this method.
