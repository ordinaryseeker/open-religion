<h3><strong>Motivation</strong></h3>
How do we know what information to believe?

The world we live in today has a vast amount of information, more than any single human can learn in a lifetime and it is divided into multiple disciplines. In addition, new discoveries or claims of discoveries are made everyday. Some of this information ends up in our newspapers, search results, social media, etc and it may be incomplete, misleading or even incorrect.

Not only does each of us have to personally make decisions based this information (for example diet, career or health care choice) but also, in democracies, we have to support public policy decisions based on it. Hence this question is very important.
<h3><strong>Content</strong></h3>
One of the most important questions that humanity has had to figure out is how to acquire true knowledge about the nature of reality. For most of humanity this question did not have a satisfactory answer.

One of the historically most popular methods of acquiring knowledge is "Revelation", where some all-knowing, all-powerful being would revel a truth about reality to a person. This method still has a strong grasp on a large percentage of human population. The benefits of this method are obvious, we get certainty that this information is true because it comes directly from the creator of the universe.  Unfortunately the drawback of this method is that anybody can claim to have had a revelation and we would just have to take their word for it. What happens when different revelations contradict each other or even our observed reality? Humans have killed each other or turned a blind eye to observed reality to keep the certainty of their revealed truths.

Another popular method was deducing the nature of reality by logical thinking. One could sit in an arm chair or in a cave and work out how the world worked just by carefully thinking about it. Unfortunately the world we lived in proved to be a little too complex for this method. For example just by your daily experience it is easy to think that the earth is flat and that the sun goes around the earth. While seemingly so obvious, we now know that these claims are not true.

A related method to the two above is getting knowledge from an authority. We believed something to be true just because an important person or book or tablet said it. This method, while convenient, does leave the question open how did that person or author of the book or tablet know the truth. And we get back to square one.

<strong>The Scientific Method</strong>

One of the remarkable discoveries of the past few centuries  is the "Scientific Method". Stated simply, the method is the following steps
<ol>
 	<li>Coming up with a specific question about the world</li>
 	<li>Observing the world and proposing an answer to the question (a hypothesis)</li>
 	<li>Making a testable and falsifiable prediction based on this answer</li>
 	<li>Running controlled experiments to gather evidence to dis-confirm our prediction</li>
 	<li>Being open to conditionally accept or permanently reject a hypothesis based on the evidence.</li>
 	<li>Publication of procedure and results and it's verification by peers.</li>
</ol>
This seemingly mundane process has lead to a rapid acceleration in our knowledge in the past 300 odd years. Note a few subtle peculiarities
<ol>
 	<li>Science is not a bunch of facts, it is a process, a step by step method.</li>
 	<li>In our experiments,  we always seek evidence to dis-confirm our hypothesis. This is because it is easy to only seek evidence to confirm our pet theory and then give up the search.</li>
 	<li>A controlled experiment means taking two or more groups and holding everything else constant but only changing the variable under study. This is difficult to do with humans because of differences in genetics, environments, habits etc. Therefore human experiments need large sample sizes.</li>
 	<li>The truth value of any claim depends on many scientists verifying the results of the experiment and reaching a consensus. It does not depend on the qualifications of the scientist or her past successes.</li>
 	<li>Lastly, you never accept a hypothesis permanently, you only accept it  conditionally. Which means if the evidence changes (example your peers are unable to reproduce your results or find flaws in your methodology) then you are open to refuting it. On the other hand refutation is often permanent.</li>
</ol>
<strong>The Scientific Method : Drawbacks</strong>

The scientific method is not perfect. But it is the best that we have so far. Following are some of the drawbacks of the scientific method
<ol>
 	<li>We have to give up the notion of "certainty" and accept "most probable given the evidence".</li>
 	<li>We have to realize that not everything worth observing is observable directly and so we have to settle for imperfect indirect measures.</li>
 	<li>Any search with this method requires funding and resources (unlike revelations and thinking which can be done for free). This might insert limitations and even biases into the process.</li>
 	<li>Lastly, there is the "is-ought problem". Just by knowing how things are today or were in the past is not always enough to determine how things should be in the future. The Scientific Method has something to offer here if different policies can be tried out experimentally or occurred in the past due to accidents of history but if those options are not available we are largely left to our older methods of thinking and intuition.</li>
</ol>
But to conclude, it is important to note that despite its drawbacks the Scientific Method is the only reliable method of knowing the nature of reality known to man. We have known more about the world in the past 300 years than the hundred thousand years before that combined, thanks to this method. As a layperson whenever you come across a new scientific fact, filter it through the following test
<ol>
 	<li>Was a controlled experiment conducted to support this claim?</li>
 	<li>How big was the sample size?</li>
 	<li>How well replicated are the results? Do different experiments arrive at the same result?</li>
 	<li>Are there any conflict of interests in the people funding/conducting the experiment?</li>
</ol>
<strong>Is Open Religion Scientific?</strong>

Yes and No. There are two aspects of Open Religion.
<ol>
 	<li>Open Religion should always be based on Scientific Facts, provide references for relevant studies and should be updated as new facts come to light.</li>
 	<li>Open Religion itself is not a scientific endeavor because it is in the business of recommending how a person or society should be in the future to maximize well-being and we have not run hundreds of experiments to pick these recommendations. Also there is no one recommendation that works perfectly for everyone. So the method employed is to list options in each category for individuals to pick, modify or reject.</li>
</ol>
