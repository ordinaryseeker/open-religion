<h3><strong>Motivation</strong></h3>
The world we live in today has a vast amount of information, more than any single human can learn in a lifetime and new discoveries are happening everyday. Much of the information that ends up in our emails, chats, newspapers may be incomplete, misleading or even incorrect. How do we know what information to believe?

A discussion below about how knowledge has been acquired throughout human history. The pros and cons of the major methods and its implications on Open Religion.
<h3><strong>Content</strong></h3>
One of the most important questions that humanity has had to figure out is how to acquire true knowledge about the nature of reality. For most of humanity this question did not have a satisfactory answer.

One of the most impactful methods of acquiring important knowledge was "Revelation", where some supernatural being/power would revel a truth about reality to a person. The benefits of this method were obvious, we just had to wait for enough revelations to get a complete picture of reality.  Unfortunately the drawback was that anybody could claim to have had a revelation and we would just have to take their word for it. Also different revelations could contradict each other or even reality.

Another popular method was deducing the nature of reality by logical thinking. One could sit in an arm chair or in a cave and work out how the world worked just by carefully thinking about it. Unfortunately the world we lived in proved to be a little too complex for this method. For example just by your daily experience it is easy to think that the earth is flat and that the sun goes around the earth. While seemingly so obvious, we now know that these claims are not true.

A related method to the two above is getting knowledge from an authority. We believed something to be true just because an important person or book or tablet said it. This method, while convenient, does leave the question open how did that person or author of the book or tablet know the truth. And we get back to square one.

One of the remarkable discoveries of the past few centuries  is the "Scientific Method".  Stated simply it is the method of observing the world around us, coming up with an explanation for the thing we observe (a hypotheses), running experiments to gather evidence to dis-confirm our hypotheses, being open to conditionally accept or permanently reject a hypotheses based on the evidence and verification of procedure/results by peers. This seemingly mundane process has lead to rapid acceleration in our knowledge acquisition about the world over the last three hundred odd years.

Note three subtle peculiarities of this method. In our experiments,  we always seek evidence to dis-confirm our hypotheses. This is because it is easy to only seek evidence to confirm our pet theory and then give up the search.  For example if I observe a few cows and they are black and so I make an hypotheses that "All cows are black". To support my hypotheses it is not enough just to gather evidence of how many black cows I have seen since this claim because observing even one non-black cow will refute the claim.  So it is important to seek evidence to refute your own claim .

Also it is important to frame a hypotheses in a way that it is testable and falsifiable . If I claim that "Some cows appear purple to me". This claim is not testable by others since they cannot see what colors I see. Similarly if I claim "If you see a red cow  something good will happen that day", this claim is not falsifiable since I can spin any event in the day or the absence of a bad event to claim it to be "good".

Lastly you never accept a hypotheses permanently, you only accept it  conditionally. Which means if the evidence changes (example your peers are unable to reproduce your results or find flaws in your methodology) then you are open to refuting it. On the other hand refutation is often permanent.

Does the scientific method have any drawbacks? Of course! It has a few.

First, we have to give up the notion of "certainty" and accept "most probable given the evidence".

Second we have to realize that not everything worth observing is observable directly and so we have to settle for imperfect indirect measures. For example we might want to observe the exact chemical composition of the earth when it was formed but that data is not preserved directly anywhere and so we just have look for known signatures of candidate chemicals for evidence. A big problem related to this is "Correlation is not Causation". Basically it means that sometimes in our indirect measures we see two phenomenon or events always happening together but they may not be the cause and effect and instead just be two dependents on a third causative factor.

Also, any search with this method needs funding and resources (unlike revelations and thinking which can be done for free). This might insert limitations and even biases into the process.

Lastly, there is the "is-ought problem". Just by knowing how things are today or were in the past is not always enough to determine how things should be in the future. The Scientific Method has something to offer here if different policies can be tried out experimentally or occurred in the past due to accidents of history but if those options are not available we are largely left to our older methods of thinking and intuition.

But to conclude, it is important to note that despite its drawbacks the Scientific Method is the only reliable method of knowing the nature of reality known to man. We have known more about the world in the past 300 years than the hundred thousand years before that combined, thanks to this method. As a layperson whenever you come across a new scientific fact, filter it through the following test
<ol>
 	<li>How big was the sample size? Bigger the better.</li>
 	<li>How well replicated are the results?</li>
 	<li>Are there any conflict of interests in the people funding/conducting the experiment?</li>
</ol>
Another reason to  talk about this topic is to highlight two aspects of Open Religion.
<ol>
 	<li>Open Religion should always be based on Scientific Facts, provide references for relevant studies and should be updated as new facts come to light.</li>
 	<li>Open Religion itself is not a scientific endeavor because it is in the business of recommending how a person or society should be in the future to maximize well-being and we have not run hundreds of experiments to pick these recommendations. Also there is no one recommendation that works perfectly for everyone. So the method employed is to list options in each category for individuals to pick, modify or reject.</li>
</ol>
