<h3>Motivation</h3>
Many concepts in older religions from heavens to reincarnation and souls are means to soothe us into thinking that death is not the end of us. Death-denial has its benefits for a person and for the society but it also prevents certain better approaches to life from developing and may even cause harm. Given its inevitability, how should one approach one's own death? How should society approach death?
