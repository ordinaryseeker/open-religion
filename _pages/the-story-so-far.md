One function of every religion is to give its followers an understanding of what sort of world they live in, a "worldview". Who are we? Why are we here? Where is here? How does all of this work? What happens to us after death?

Just 500 years ago, only religion could provide the answers to such questions. In modern times, we have schools, universities, books and the internet to help us get this understanding. But the amount of information available today is so vast and mixed with so much misleading or incorrect information that people may never read the few things that can help them form an accurate "worldview". And even if they read some it, it is not presented in a way to help form a "worldview" and so it does not get the frequent deliberation it deserves to truly internalize it.

Hence to bring all of us on the same page, we must review a very concise yet insightful history of the the world we live in, some of the principles which make it work and the implications of some of the major recent discoveries on the human journey and the central character of most religions, God.
