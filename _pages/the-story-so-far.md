One function of every religion is to give its followers an understanding of what sort of world they live in, a "worldview". In modern times, we have schools, universities and Wikipedia to help us get this understanding. But the amount of information available today is so vast that people may never read the few things that can help form an accurate "worldview" or even if they read it, it is not emphasized or presented in a way to help form a "worldview". Hence to bring all of us on the same page, we must review a very concise yet insightful history of the the world we live in, some of the principles which make it work and the implications of some of the major discoveries on the human journey and the central character of most religions, God.
