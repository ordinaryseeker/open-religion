<h2>Motivation</h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Religion is a dirty word.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For atheists and agnostics, Religion is the source of superstition, oppression and even murder and war.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For religious people, every other Religion except their own is either idiotic, misguided or the work of evil forces.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So why bother reading, trying or co-creating something that nobody wants?</span>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being born human is in some ways like waking up on a stage with some unknown play already in progress all around you. You watch it for sometime in a confused state. Who are these weird characters? What do all these strange words mean? What is everyone trying to do? What should I do?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Slowly you learn some story and character information from others around you. But they were not there from the beginning either, so their descriptions of the play are also just interpretations of the interpretations that they heard from others.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In time, you learn enough useful information to enjoy parts of the play, but a lot of the information proves incorrect leaving you confused, in self-doubt and in suffering. Before you have figured everything out, you are forced out of the theater and then it is “The End” for you.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It would have been nice to have a script or an Owner’s Manual to make sense of this experience and make it more enjoyable. Unfortunately, none of us are born with such an Owner's Manual.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So the rest of us have put together this Owner’s Manual for you. It is just a collection of interpretations about the nature of this universe and a collection of practices for taking care of self and others.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While different combinations of these interpretations and practices can be helpful to different people, these interpretations are NOT the Absolute Truth and the list of practices is not exhaustive. Hence this Manual is incomplete.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our hope is that by standing on the shoulders of those who came before you, you can see further than any of us. This Manual is your's now. Do whatever you want with it. Read it, try it, ignore it, burn it or improve it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, enjoy this magical play.</span>
