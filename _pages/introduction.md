We live in a magical world. Not the kind of magic we see in movies or in magic shows but a kind of magic that is almost invisible to us, hidden in plain sight, unless we take the effort to stop, observe and experience.

Why is there something in the universe rather than nothing? How does life form out of lifeless material? How does life acquire consciousness? These Big Questions have troubled philosophers for millennia. Most of us do not spare much time to think about these questions but the stories used to explain the creation of the universe and human beings affect our life through deeply Personal Questions like, What is the purpose of my life? How should I treat myself? How should I treat others?

Even if we have never thought about these Personal Questions, we subconsciously absorb these answers from the society around us and they become our Default Settings. Unbeknownst to us, these Default Settings drive every aspect of our life, what we desire, how we act, how we love, how we hate, how we enjoy and how we suffer.

If you were born and raised in a loving, caring and secure family, community and society, your Default Settings may be good enough to take you through your life without much despair. But on the other hand if you were surrounded by hatred, greed and insecurity, your Default Settings are probably causing a lot of avoidable suffering to yourself and those around you.

<strong>The mission of Open Religion is to give you the tools required to recognize and fine tune your Default Settings so that you can minimize suffering and maximize joy in your life.</strong>

Fortunately or unfortunately, this is not just a matter of stating what the right answer is. There are two reasons for this. First, your optimum answers are unique to you and no one else can figure them out for you. Second, even if somebody had the exact answer that you need, we do not have the technology to install these answers in your brain.

This brings us to why this is a religion, instead of just a book. Just reading or hearing even the most perfect answer will make very little difference to your life. Your Default Settings are so deeply ingrained and outside your conscious control that knowledge alone is not sufficient to change them. It will take a combination of knowledge, direct experience of the nature of reality, regular practice and a supportive community to help you make this transition.

Of-course, Open Religion is not the first to try this approach. Across every region of the Earth, in every era, people have been able to attain this wisdom. For many of them, these answers came in the form of extraordinary experiences while going through some physical hardship like an illness, starvation, seizures or near death accidents. These experiences revealed a power much greater than themselves which underlies and creates all of reality.

After even a brief glimpse of this enormous power, all human desires like the desire for status, wealth or sexual conquests feel like petty childish games and all human fears like the fear of not being good enough, of not being loved and even the fear of death dissolve into the awe and love of this power.

Alas, most of the times, this state of bliss does not last forever and the Default Settings of people take over again and with them come the petty human desires and fears. But once a person gets a taste of this Bliss, a search begins to reunite with this power again.

Over thousands of years, the incredible humans that have existed before us have discovered hundreds of methods to experience and remain in union with this power. Most humans who attain this Bliss may choose to not return back to the mundane human life at all but some want to share this wisdom and their methods with the rest of humanity. This is the seed of all religions that have ever existed on this earth.

But if this is the case, why is there so much suffering in the world? Why are all of us not united with this Bliss. This is because there is a fundamental problem with any human interpreting and conveying this extraordinary wisdom. And this problem is Language.

Language is a very useful tool but it can only capture experiences using concepts which are familiar to both the speaker and the listener. For example, try describing the taste of an exotic fruit or a foreign delicacy to a friend who has not eaten it. Notice how you try to fit the experience of taste into the approximate concepts offered by words. Check with your friend to see what they imagined the taste to be from the description you gave and ask them to transmit it to another person and see how well even an ordinary experience like taste can be transmitted through words.

The universe that we live in is so complex that no human language comes even close to capturing this complexity in words. Hence making sense of these extraordinary experiences and communicating them to others is a very difficult task and prone to misinterpretation and corruption over time.The diagram below tries to capture this difficulty in transmitting wisdom through words alone.

<a href="http://www.theopenreligion.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/TransmissionProblem.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-369" src="http://www.theopenreligion.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/TransmissionProblem.png" alt="" width="2733" height="1542" /></a>

Over time these stories coalesced into organized religions and in turn these religions created rules for how people should live their lives and treat others. For atleast the past ten thousand years, since the end of the last ice age and advent of agriculture, religions have played a very important role in helping us understand the world around us and how we should live in it. But due to the transmission problem shown above, even with the best intentions of the followers, after the death of the original teacher, the teachings got corrupted after a few years. To make matters even worse, religions became a source of power and prestige and attracted people who wanted to use them to exploit others and benefit themselves. In the midst of all this chaos, a new person may attain wisdom, rebel against the old corrupt system and start the cycle all over again.

Our ancestors who created these stories and rules were very wise people and we must assume that they did the best job they could with the information, experiences and situations they had on hand but the progress that humanity has made in the past 300 years in understanding the world has shaken the foundations of many of these stories. Especially in the past 100 years, this progress has been accelerating  and changing our environments so rapidly that most of humanity has not had the “mental bandwidth” to imbibe the profound implications of these changes into their daily lives. On one hand we have developed ever more deadly ways to destroy each other, other life forms and the very planet that hosts us.  On the other hand most of the world's population still holds on to the stories and rules that were developed over a 1000 years ago when we knew so little about the world. The marriage of outdated beliefs and new technology is dangerous in a world with nuclear and biological weapons and we cannot expect to survive our collective ignorance indefinitely.

But some of the stories and rules of the old religions  are still applicable to us in the 21st century because our bodies and minds have not changed much in that last 1000 years. Even more remarkably, some of the profound experiences that lie at the core of many religions like coming in contact with "God" or a "Universal Consciousness" seem to be at-least subjectively true for many people and can be accessed by most people with one of the many tools that our ancestors have discovered and bequeathed to us. Many people, who reject the old religious stories without a full understanding of the human condition either get busy perpetually chasing fleeting pleasures, status and wealth , at great cost to their own well being and that of others or they feel a void of true meaning and purpose in their lives and eventually become disillusioned or even depressed.

Open Religion is an attempt to distill those aspects of older religions which still hold true for the human condition but modify those aspects which have become outdated in face of modern discoveries and create new stories and rules for the new society we want to create for ourselves and for our children. A new society, in which human ingenuity is applied not towards flaming our petty pleasures, enmities and egos but towards wiping out human suffering, stewarding our planet and navigating the next big milestones for humanity responsibly, like colonizing space, creating artificial intelligence and upgrading our genes.

Older religions faced many constraints. To spread their stories and rules to a mostly uneducated population without access to modern means of communication, most older religions needed to base their authority on the divine word of an omniscient being. Hence they actively tried to prevent human updates. Open Religion is being created in a very different era where the internet has brought the means of education and communication to a majority of human population. Hence it has the luxury to acknowledge that it is a very human creation and has all the flaws and imperfections of its creators. It also has the luxury to include an update mechanism that can allow people from around the world to contribute their wisdom, correct its flaws and respond to new changes in human knowledge.

Following in the footsteps of the great religions of the past this Owner's Manual will stand on three pillars of belief, behavior and belonging. The first section provides a concise but simple introduction to the nature of reality that we find ourselves in. The second section gives you recommendations on how best to treat yourself, mind and body. The third section gives you recommendations on how to treat others so that both you and they can make most of this shared experience. The final section adds a fourth pillar of organization structure. This is a pillar that older religion founders either neglected or could not fully understand the long term implications of the structures that they chose. Religion is a powerful force and any organization structure that controls such a powerful force has a high chance of becoming corrupt and oppressive. Therefore Open Religion will have a mostly decentralized organization structure and what little centralization it has will only have recommending power and be in service of the decentralized parts. This manual is one of the centralized parts of Open Religion and so remember that everything that follows are just recommendations and you are free to believe whatever you want and live however you want.

Being born human is in some ways like waking up in a theater with some unknown movie playing on the big screen. You watch it for some time in a confused state. Slowly you learn some plot and character information from others who were there before you but not from the beginning. In time you learn enough to enjoy parts of it, to be hurt by parts of it and even be amazed by parts of it but you are forced out of the theater long before the movie is over or you have figured everything out and then its “Game Over” for you. It would have been nice to have an owner’s manual to make sense of this experience and make it more enjoyable. Well this is that Owner’s Manual and its yours now. Do what you want with it and enjoy this magical ride.
