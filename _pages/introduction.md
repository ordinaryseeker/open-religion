We live in a magical world. Not the kind of magic we see in movies or in magic shows but a kind of magic that is almost invisible to us unless we take the effort to stop, observe and ponder. Why is there something in the universe rather than nothing? Why are there billions of stars? Why does life exist on Earth? How does life form out of lifeless material? How does life diversify into millions of different species? How does life acquire consciousness? These "Big Questions" have troubled philosophers for millennia. Arguably the list of magical phenomena was even longer until just a few centuries ago. Everything from thunder to tides to human diseases required supernatural explanations. The human mind wants answers and it is not shy to invent them when none are within easy grasp.

&nbsp;

The answers to these “Big Questions” also have implication on our daily lives. The frameworks used to explain the creation of the universe and life have trickle down corollaries that affect people’s lives via deeply personal questions like, What is the purpose of my life? How should I treat myself? How should I treat others? For atleast the past ten thousand years, since the end of the last ice age and advent of agriculture, religions have played a very important role in spreading certain frameworks for understanding the world around us and how we should live in it. These frameworks are not without their merit and their explaining power and stickiness are certainly marvelous since even children or people in remote villages can understand and imbibe them but they have become outdated and also, arguably, dangerous.
The progress that humanity has made in the past 300 years in understanding the world has shaken the foundations of many of these religious frameworks. Especially in the past 100 years, the progress has been accelerating so rapidly that most of humanity has not had the “bandwidth” to imbibe the implications of these discoveries into their daily lives. The marriage of outdated beliefs and new technology is dangerous in a world with nuclear weapons and we cannot expect to survive our collective ignorance indefinitely. Even more radical changes are on the horizon, from Artificial Intelligence to a deathless life to space colonization and these will require new social frameworks. On the other hand if you abandon these old frameworks without discretion, you might find yourself either running exhaustedly on the hedonic treadmill, or sleepwalking through life or despairing about the purposelessness of any endeavor.

&nbsp;

The Open Religion is an attempt to distill the most important updates to human knowledge into an easy to understand framework for the world we live in and its implications for our own lives and those of other conscious beings around us. At its very core Open Religion tries to explore what it means to be an “Evolved Being” rather than a “Created Being”. It takes inspiration from the best ideas in the religious traditions of the world but also aspires to fix a big flaw embedded in them, the lack of an update mechanism. While most religions based their authority on the divine word of an omniscient being and hence actively tried to prevent human updates, Open Religion is a very human creation and hence acknowledges that there remains much to be yet discovered and will design an update mechanism into itself.
Given the odds of us being alive, conscious and intelligent on this planet and at this time in history, we would say its a pretty magical world. But being born human is in some ways like walking into a theater long after the movie has started, watching it for some time in a confused state, being amazed by parts of it, enjoying parts of it, being hurt by parts of it but walking out long before the movie ends. It would have been nice to have an owner’s manual to make sense of this experience and make it more enjoyable. Open Religion aspires to be that Owner’s Manual. We hope you find it useful.

&nbsp;

Enjoy the ride.
