<h3>Motivation</h3>
When we first become aware of the world around us, it is easy to assume that the world has been more or less the same for a long time. As we grow up we learn about some of the changes that have happened in the recent history. But nothing can prepare us to internalize the bizarre and complex history of the world. Therefore, below is a visual representation of where we are in space and time and how and when we came to know about it. We recommend that you stare at the pictures below for a few minutes everyday and ponder over the scale of things to remind yourself of your place in the world.

<strong>Where are we in time?</strong>

As far as we know, the universe was created 13.8 billion years ago, the earth was formed roughly 4.54 billion years ago, earliest life on earth was formed roughly 4.1 billion years ago and modern humans were formed about 200,000 years ago and the first recorded complex societies are from 3500 years ago. But there are twists and turns on every timeline below and so we highly recommend that you explore more about these on Wikipedia.

<strong>Where are we in Space?</strong>

The world is very old and humans are relatively very recent and civilization even more so but the world is also very large and we are very tiny in comparison. The earth might seem very big to us but it is just one of the smaller planets which orbits around our Sun, which itself is one of the billions of stars in our galaxy Milky Way, which itself is one of the billions of galaxies in the observable universe.

<strong>Timeline of human's discoveries.</strong>

The vastness of time and space is truly humbling but when did we figure out that we live in such an old and large universe
