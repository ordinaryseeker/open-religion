<h3>Motivation</h3>
How to choose the governing body to ensure openness, accuracy and effectiveness of Open Religion?
<h3>Content</h3>
Creating an organization is more art than science. Even the best thought out plans can have unintended consequences. But not having an organization is a recipe for disaster for the cause. Very few causes have been successful without an organization and if they are faced with organized competitors, they are more likely to loose  out. The challenge is to find the right amount of structure to help the organization grow in the right direction while having the right amount of decentralization to avoid becoming oppressive or even cult-ish.

In this regard, the closest inspiration for governance models are the various Open Source Software Communities like Linux, Debian, Ubuntu and the crowd-sourced encyclopedia, Wikipedia. But many of them have a decentralized model under a Benevolent Dicatator for Life (BDFL) which can be problematic for a religion.  In many ways the stakes and possibilities of abuse of power are higher in a religion than in software
