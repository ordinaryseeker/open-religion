<h3>Motivation</h3>
How to choose the governing body to ensure openness, accuracy and effectiveness of Open Religion?
<h3>Content</h3>
Creating an organization is more art than science. Even the best thought out plans can have unintended consequences. But not having an organization is a recipe for disaster for the cause. Very few causes have been successful without an organization and if they are faced with organized competitors, they are more likely to loose  out. The challenge is to find the right amount of structure to help the organization grow in the right direction while having the right amount of decentralization to avoid becoming oppressive or even cult-ish.

In this regard, one inspiration for governance models is those of consensus based member-owned cooperatives and another is Open Source software communities like Linux, Debian, Ubuntu and the crowd-sourced encyclopedia, Wikipedia. A merging of these two models would be needed to govern Open Religion since what works in a small, tight-knit community of members may not work in the anonymous world of the internet where a few loud voices can drown out a silent majority. But also having a decentralized model under a Benevolent Dicatator for Life (BDFL) like many Open Source software communities may be problematic for a religion.  In many ways the stakes and possibilities of abuse of power are higher in a religion than in software.

One concept that can help merge these two models is called Proof of Work used in decentralized communities like BitCoin which weights the vote of each member in a consensus based system by a amount of "Work" that the member has done to advance the goals of this community. Another version of these is  called "karma points" in online communities like Reddit.
<ol>
 	<li>What are goals of this organization?</li>
 	<li>What activities count as "work" towards these goals? How many "karma points" for each such activity?</li>
 	<li>What are  the roles and responsibilities of members with higher "karma points"?</li>
</ol>
