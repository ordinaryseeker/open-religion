<h3>Motivation</h3>
Are men and women equal? Why? Or Why not? How should we treat each other?

What about homo sexuals? Transgender?
<h3>Content</h3>
Women, all over the world and through recorded history, form the largest group of humans who have been denied their individual freedoms, treated as property or worse and have been subjected to humiliation, harm and death under the banner of religion and culture.

What kind of world should Open Religion aspire to in this regard and how to change from the current state to that world?
