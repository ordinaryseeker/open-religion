I am a fool. I have no business writing this book or starting a religion. I am not in communication with the divine, I am not enlightened, I am not even a scholar of anything, I am nobody. In fact, I feel weirdly criminal even writing this book. The founders of most religious movements in the last 200 years have either been delusional, ego-maniacs, con-men or fools. I hope I am just a fool. Religion is very much an inter-disciplinary topic encompassing psychology, philosophy, history, cosmology, economics, sociology and many other disciplines and I am not an expert in any of them. Any real experts in these fields would know better than starting a religious movement. It is a career-ending move for any academic and might even be a life-ending move given the state of affairs in today's world. To misquote a famous line, fools rush in where the wise fear to tread.

But I am also a concerned citizen and a curious person, interested in understanding how the world works and how to best live my own life. In this quest, I have come across some worrying trends for the future of humanity and also some genuine sources of insight that can help us amidst a sea of either half-baked, misleading or incorrect theories. I have come to believe, that the next 100 years are very crucial in determining the future of humanity. How we handle the looming problems of social inequality in face of a climate crises, increasing automation of work, genetic engineering of humans and the proliferation of destructive technology, will determine if we die out, get knocked back 10000 years or elevate ourselves to the next level of a civilization by becoming a united, happy multi-planetary species.

Right now, the first two bad outcomes seem more likely. With climate change will come flooding and desertification of some of our most populous and agriculturally active areas. With that will come mass migrations and then revolts and war. And with that may come a nuclear winter. If there is even a small possibility of this happening, it may be worth it to take steps to avoid it. But how can we do it when we are so divided by money, by our imaginary fairy-tale religions  and by of our lack of caring for ourselves and others.

I believe that one answer lies in shaping what we want with a better understanding of our place in the universe and through that a better understanding of how to treat ourselves and others.  In humanities' past transitions, this has been done by religions. I have resisted this foolish idea of forming such a religion for many years but when I see the suffering in this world of abundance, I am repeatedly drawn to it again. Finally, after the 2016 election in the USA, I could no longer hold back and decided to jump in.

But I could not just release an empty shell hoping for people to contribute. So I have created an outline and added content that points in the direction I would like to take this work. For now some of the general principles I have followed are as follows
<ol>
 	<li>Keep it scientifically accurate. If speculating or over generalizing, annotate it as such.</li>
 	<li>Keep the language simple. Aim for average high school reading levels.</li>
 	<li>Keep it short and highlight key takeaways.</li>
</ol>
My inspiration for this project is the community of commentators at Hacker News who many times find a way to distill wisdom and bring it forth in even the extremely insensitive, bullying and factually incorrect world of online comments. Most of the work in this book is not original. It is either paraphrased or inspired from other writers.  Though they do not know about this work, I would like to extended my thanks to John and Hank Green at Crash Course, Sam Harris author of End of Faith and Waking Up, Alain de Button at School of Life, Jonathan Haidt author of Happiness Hypothesis, Daniel Dennet author of Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Ted Talks and a myriad youtube vloggers. All of whom, themselves, stand on shoulders of philosophers and scientists, named and unknown, going back thousands of years and many of whom may not agree with each other on everything.

I state all this, not with any pride but as a warning for the imperfection of this author and his material. It is meant to be updated and perfected. That is why it is v0.1
