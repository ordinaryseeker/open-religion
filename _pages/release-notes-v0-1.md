The founders of most modern religious movements have either been delusional, ego-maniacs, con-men or idiots.  I would request the readers and future contributors to Open Religion to treat me like an idiot.

&nbsp;

Religion is a very much an inter-disciplinary topic encompassing psychology, philosophy, history, cosmology, economics, sociology and many other disciplines and I am not an expert in any of them. Any real experts in these fields would know better than starting a religious movement. It is a career-ending move for any academic and might even be a life-ending move given the state of affairs in today's world.

&nbsp;

I am just a curious person, interested in understanding how the world works and how to best live my own life. In this quest, I have come across many genuine sources of insight amidst a sea of either half-baked, misleading or incorrect theories. I want to distill the true wisdom by crowd-sourcing it and hence create a guide that I would like to use myself.

&nbsp;

I could not just release an empty shell hoping for people to contribute. So I have created an outline and added content that points in the direction I would like to take this work. Some of the general principles I have followed are as follows
<ol>
 	<li>Keep it scientifically accurate. If speculating or over generalizing, annotate it as such.</li>
 	<li>Keep the language simple. Aim for average high school reading levels.</li>
 	<li>Keep it well structured, short and highlight key takeaways.</li>
</ol>
Most of the work in this book is not original. It is either paraphrased or inspired from other writers.  Though they do not know about this work, I would like to extended my thanks to John and Hank Green at Crash Course, Sam Harris author of End of Faith and Waking Up, Alain de Button at School of Life, Jonathan Haidt author of Happiness Hypothesis, Daniel Dennet author of Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Ted Talks and a myriad youtube vloggers.

&nbsp;

I state all this, not with any pride but as a warning for the imperfection of this material. It is meant to be updated and perfected. That is why it is v0.1
