<h3><strong>Motivation</strong></h3>
Before we can take even the first step in understanding the world we live in, we must confront a very important question, How do we know what information to believe?

The world we live in today has a vast amount of information, more than any single human can learn in a lifetime and it is divided into multiple disciplines. In addition, new discoveries or claims of discoveries are made everyday. Some of this information ends up in our newspapers, search results, social media, etc and it may be incomplete, misleading or even incorrect.

Not only does each of us have to personally make decisions based this information (for example diet, career or health care choices) but also, in democracies, we have to support public policy decisions based on it. If we get this one skill wrong, it could mean inflicting unnecessary suffering on ourselves and our societies.
<h3><strong>Content</strong></h3>
One of the most important questions that humanity has had to figure out is how to acquire true knowledge about the nature of reality. For most of humanity this question did not have a satisfactory answer.

One of the historically most significant methods of acquiring knowledge is "Revelation", where some all-knowing, all-powerful being would revel a truth about reality to a person. The benefits of this method are obvious, we get certainty that this information is true because it comes directly from the creator of the universe.  Unfortunately the drawback of this method is that anybody can claim to have had a revelation and we would just have to take their word for it. What happens when different revelations contradict each other or even our observed reality? Humans have killed each other by the millions or turned a blind eye to observed reality to keep the certainty of their revealed truths.

Another method popular among ancient philosophers was deducing the nature of reality by logical thinking. One could sit in an arm chair or in a cave and work out how the world worked just by carefully thinking about it . Unfortunately the world we live in has proved to be a little too complex for this method. For example just by your daily experience it is easy to think that the earth is flat and that the sun goes around the earth. While seemingly so obvious, we now know that these claims are not true.

An outwardly similar looking method to logical thinking is introspection or meditation. In this method one observes the nature of one's own thoughts and feelings and draws conclusions about the nature of reality based on this experience. This method  does seem to provide insight into the nature of subjective reality (for example I feel happy when I see a sunrise) but has not been able to shed light on the nature of objective reality (for example Why does the sun rise?)

The most popular method of all time though is getting knowledge from an authority. We believe something to be true just because an important person or book or tablet said it. This method is convenient because no one person can know everything about everything but it does leave the question open of how did that authority or author of the book or tablet know the truth and this leads us back to the three methods discussed above.

<strong>The Scientific Method</strong>

One of the remarkable discoveries of the past few centuries  is the Scientific Method. Stated simply, the method is the following steps
<ol>
 	<li>Coming up with a specific question about the world</li>
 	<li>Observing the world and proposing an answer to the question (a hypothesis)</li>
 	<li>Making a testable and falsifiable prediction based on this answer</li>
 	<li>Running controlled experiments to gather evidence to dis-confirm our prediction</li>
 	<li>Being open to conditionally accept or permanently reject a hypothesis based on the evidence.</li>
 	<li>Publication of procedure and results and it's verification by peers.</li>
</ol>
This seemingly innocent process has lead to a rapid acceleration in our knowledge in the past 300 odd years and created a life of material abundance like the human species has never seen before. But a few subtle peculiarities can be easy to miss so let us take note of them
<ol>
 	<li>Science is not a bunch of facts, it is a process, a step by step method.</li>
 	<li>In our experiments,  we always seek evidence to dis-confirm our hypothesis. This is because it is easy to only seek evidence to confirm our pet theory and then give up the search.</li>
 	<li>A controlled experiment means taking two or more groups and holding everything else constant but only changing the variable under study. This is difficult to do with humans because of differences in genetics, environments, habits etc. Therefore human experiments need large sample sizes in each group with the hope that when we take an average the other differences cancel each other out and we see the effect of our variable under study clearly.</li>
 	<li>The truth value of any claim depends on many scientists verifying the results of the experiment and reaching a consensus. It does not depend on the qualifications of the scientist or her past successes.</li>
 	<li>Lastly, you never accept a hypothesis permanently, you only accept it  conditionally. Which means if the evidence changes (example your peers are unable to reproduce your results or find flaws in your methodology) then you are open to refuting it. On the other hand refutation is often permanent.</li>
</ol>
<strong>The Scientific Method : Drawbacks</strong>

The scientific method is not perfect. But it is the best that we have so far. Following are some of the drawbacks of the scientific method
<ol>
 	<li>We have to give up the notion of "certainty" and accept "most probable given the evidence".</li>
 	<li>We have to realize that not everything worth observing is observable directly and so we have to settle for imperfect indirect measures.</li>
 	<li>Any search with this method requires funding and resources (unlike revelations and thinking which can be done for free). This inserts limitations and even biases into the process.</li>
 	<li>Lastly, there is the "is-ought problem". Just by knowing how things are today or were in the past is not always enough to determine how things should be in the future. The Scientific Method has something to offer here if different policies can be tried out experimentally or occurred in the past due to accidents of history but if those options are not available we are largely left to our older methods of thinking and intuition.</li>
</ol>
As a layperson whenever you come across new information, filter it through the following test to know how much trust to put on it
<ol>
 	<li>Is this an anecdote from one or multiple people with known or possible bad motives? -&gt;<span style="background-color: #ff0000;"> No Trust</span></li>
 	<li>Is this an anecdote from a single person with unknown motives? -&gt; <span style="background-color: #ff0000;">No Trust</span></li>
 	<li>Is this an anecdote from a known person of good motives or multiple people of unknown motives? -&gt;<span style="background-color: #ff9900;"> Low Trust + Caution + Curiosity</span></li>
 	<li>Is this my personal experience? -&gt; <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Medium Trust + Caution  + Curiosity</span></li>
 	<li>Is this the result of a small controlled study? -&gt;<span style="background-color: #ffff00;"> Medium Trust + Caution + Curiosity</span></li>
 	<li>Is this the result of large controlled study? -&gt; <span style="background-color: #99cc00;">Trust + Caution + Curiosity</span></li>
 	<li>Is this the result of multiple large controlled and replicated studies? -&gt; <strong><span style="background-color: #008000;">Strong Trust</span></strong></li>
</ol>
The color scheme used above will also be used in the rest of this book  when making or evaluating recommendations because unfortunately not everything worth studying has been studied with large controlled and replicated studies.

To conclude, it is important to note that despite its drawbacks the Scientific Method is the only reliable method of knowing the nature of reality known to man. We have known more about the world in the past 300 years than the 100000 years before that combined, thanks to this method.
