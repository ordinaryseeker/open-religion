<h2>How to use Open Religion?</h2>
<p>Open religion is an eternally incomplete manual for this magical life. It is an attempt to collect methods of self development and self-realization from all humans who have existed so that each of us can take whatever works best for us, enhance what does not work and pass on greater wisdom to the future generations to build on.</p>
