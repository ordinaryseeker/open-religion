<h3>Motivation</h3>
Based on the principles we have seen throughout this book, it would be dishonest to "command" anyone to do anything but we can certainly try to distill Open Religion into ten recommendations for the ease of remembering and maximizing effectiveness for the individual and society. Â If nothing else, it acts as a TL;DR.
<h3>Content</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>Everyday hold these two opposing thoughts in your head and in times of trouble or tough decisions, you will have clarity.
<ol>
 	<li>Remind yourself how small you are by thinking of the vastness of the universe. May be a <a href="http://www.openreligion.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/EarthInTheUniverse.jpg">poster </a>like this on your wall can help.</li>
 	<li>Remind yourself how special you are to be alive and conscious at this moment. May be a <a href="http://www.openreligion.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Emergence2.jpg">poster </a>like this on your wall can help.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Everyday remember that you are the product of a blind process aka Evolution and so your body and mind are imperfect in many ways. Do these three things for yourself
<ol>
 	<li>Body : Eat Healthy, Restrict Calories intermittently, Exercise.</li>
 	<li>Mind : Meditate, Exercise, Choose addictive substances wisely.</li>
 	<li>Environment : Create routines, Remove Distractions, Be part of community.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Your life may not have any inherent purpose and so when creating your own purposes remember the options below to mix and match as they do not saturate you easily
<ol>
 	<li>Pursuit of knowledge</li>
 	<li>Helping others through your work.</li>
 	<li>Loving and caring for partner(s) and family.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>When deciding on life partner(s) keep the following in mind</li>
 	<li>Everyday remember that others are also products of this same blind processes that made you and despite variation in individual capabilities and characteristics, each conscious being deserves complete freedom in what he or she wants to do with his or her time in this life as long as we do not harm each other.</li>
 	<li>Everyday remember that you do not deserve your poverty or prosperity if you are just born into it
<ol>
 	<li>If you are born rich, donate as much money and skills as possible to provide equal opportunities for those born into poverty to have access to good nutrition, heathcare, housing and education.</li>
 	<li>If you are born poor,</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Everyday remember that our health and prosperity depend on a very delicate ecological balance and as the most conscious species of this planet, it is our duty to be responsible stewards of this planet and commit the least amount of violence on other species especially those who show signs of consciousness.</li>
 	<li>When you come across a piece of information that claims to be a fact, pass it through the following filters before accepting it as the truth
<ol>
 	<li>Were experiments conducted to test this information?</li>
 	<li>How big was the sample size? Bigger the better.</li>
 	<li>How well replicated are the results? More the better</li>
 	<li>Are there any conflict of interests in the people funding/conducting the experiment? Less the better</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>When arguing with a person you do not agree with, follow these rules
<ol>
 	<li>Treat them with respect and know your own fallibility. No Insults.</li>
 	<li>Give clear reasons and counter-reasons</li>
 	<li>Do not hesitate to say "I don't know".</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Death is the end of this magical accident called life and while it is scary to think about, use it as a guide to live this limited amount of life to the fullest.
<ol>
 	<li>If your physical body starts failing beyond repair, do not be afraid to end your life with dignity with the help and advice of your doctor.</li>
 	<li>If your mental will to live starts failing, before ending this magical accident please consider seeking guidance and completely changing your environment for a few years.</li>
</ol>
