<h3>Motivation</h3>
Based on the principles we have seen throughout this book, it would be dishonest to "command" anyone to do anything but we can certainly try to distill Open Religion into ten recommendations for the ease of remembering and maximizing effectiveness for the individual and society. Â Also this acts as a TL;DR.
<h3>Content</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>Everyday hold these two opposing thoughts in your head.
<ol>
 	<li>Remind yourself how small you are by thinking of the vastness of the universe. May be a <a href="http://www.openreligion.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/EarthInTheUniverse.jpg">poster </a>like this on your wall can help.</li>
 	<li>Remind yourself how special you are to be alive and conscious at this moment. May be a <a href="http://www.openreligion.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Emergence2.jpg">poster </a>like this on your wall can help.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Everyday remember that you are the product of Evolution by Natural Selection and so do these three things for yourself
<ol>
 	<li>Body : Eat Healthy, Restrict Calories intermittently, Exercise.</li>
 	<li>Mind : Meditate, Exercise, Choose addictive substances wisely.</li>
 	<li>Environment : Create routines, Remove Distractions, Be part of community.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Everyday remember that others are also products of this same process and despite variation in individual capabilities and characteristics, each conscious being deserves complete freedom in what he or she wants to do with his or her time in this life as long as we do not harm each other.</li>
 	<li>Your life may not have any inherent purpose and so when creating your own purposes remember the options below to mix and match as they do not saturate you easily
<ol>
 	<li>Pursuit of knowledge</li>
 	<li>Helping others through your work.</li>
 	<li>Loving and caring for partner(s) and family.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>When you come across a new piece of scientific fact pass it through the following filters before accepting it as truth
<ol>
 	<li>How big was the sample size? Bigger the better.</li>
 	<li>How well replicated are the results?</li>
 	<li>Are there any conflict of interests in the people funding/conducting the experiment?</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>When arguing with a person you do not agree with, follow these rules
<ol>
 	<li>Treat them with respect and know your own fallibility. No Insults.</li>
 	<li>Give clear reasons and counter-reasons</li>
 	<li>Know when to give-up</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li></li>
</ol>
