<h3>Motivation</h3>
Based on the principles we have seen throughout this book, it would be dishonest to "command" anyone to do anything but we can certainly try to distill Open Religion into ten recommendations for the ease of remembering and maximizing effectiveness for the individual and society.  If nothing else, it acts as a TL;DR.
<h3>Content</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>Everyday hold these two opposing thoughts in your head
<ol>
 	<li>Remind yourself how small you are by thinking of the vastness of the universe. May be a <a href="http://www.theopenreligion.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/EarthInTheUniverse.jpg">poster </a>like this on your wall can help.</li>
 	<li>Remind yourself how special you are to be alive and conscious at this moment. May be a <a href="http://www.theopenreligion.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Emergence2.jpg">poster </a>like this on your wall can help.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Everyday remember that you are the product of a blind process aka Evolution and so your body and mind are imperfect in many ways. Do these three things for yourself
<ol>
 	<li>Body :
<ul>
 	<li>Eat Healthy: Let 50% of your plate be diverse vegetables, then healthy fats, protein, whole grains, fruit in decreasing quantity order, avoid sugar, fast once a week. feast once a week socially.</li>
 	<li>Exercise :  atleast 30 mins of high heart rate activity 4-5 times a week</li>
 	<li>Sleep : 8 hrs a day, take a nap midday, minimize caffeine, avoid blue light before sleeping</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Mind :
<ul>
 	<li>Meditate (Training Consciousness) : Observe sensations of natural breath, if thoughts draw your attention away, gently return to focusing on sensation of breath, repeat for at least 30 mins twice a day.</li>
 	<li>Choose addictive substances wisely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Environment : Create routines, Remove Distractions, Be part of community.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Your life may not have any inherent purpose and so when creating your own purposes remember the options below to mix and match as they do not saturate you easily
<ol>
 	<li>Pursuit of knowledge</li>
 	<li>Helping others through your work.</li>
 	<li>Loving and caring for partner(s) and family.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>When deciding on life partner(s) keep the following in mind</li>
 	<li>Everyday remember that others are also products of this same blind processes that made you and despite variation in individual capabilities and characteristics, each conscious being deserves complete freedom in what he or she wants to do with his or her time in this life as long as we do not harm each other.</li>
 	<li>Everyday remember that you do not deserve either your poverty or prosperity
<ol>
 	<li>If you are born rich, donate as much money and skills as possible to provide equal opportunities for those born into poverty to have access to good nutrition, heathcare, housing and education.</li>
 	<li>If you are born poor,</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Everyday remember that our health and prosperity depend on a very delicate ecological balance and as the most conscious species of this planet, it is our duty to be responsible stewards of this planet and commit the least amount of violence on other species especially those who show signs of consciousness.</li>
 	<li>Whenever you come across new information, filter it through the following test to know how much trust to put on it
<ol>
 	<li>Is this an anecdote from one or multiple people with known or possible bad motives? -&gt; No Trust</li>
 	<li>Is this an anecdote from a single person with unknown motives? -&gt; No Trust</li>
 	<li>Is this an anecdote from a known person of good motives or multiple people of unknown motives? -&gt; Low Trust + Caution + Curiosity</li>
 	<li>Is this my personal experience? -&gt; Medium Trust + Caution  + Curiosity</li>
 	<li>Is this the result of a small controlled study? -&gt; Medium Trust + Caution + Curiosity</li>
 	<li>Is this the result of large controlled study? -&gt; Trust + Caution + Curiosity</li>
 	<li>Is this the result of multiple large controlled and replicated studies? -&gt; <strong>Strong Trust</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>When discussing any idea with a person you do not agree with, follow these rules
<ol>
 	<li>First. Try to summarize their position in a way that they agree with it.</li>
 	<li>Do not hesitate to say "I don't know".</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Death is the end of this magical accident called life and while it is scary to think about, use it as a guide to live this limited amount of life to the fullest.
<ol>
 	<li>If your physical body starts failing beyond repair, do not be afraid to end your life with dignity with the help and advice of your doctor.</li>
 	<li>If your mental will to live starts failing, before ending this magical accident please consider seeking guidance and completely changing your environment for a few years.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
